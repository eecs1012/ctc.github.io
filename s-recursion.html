				<h3>&#127770; ponder-1: Computing the Sum of an Array OF Integers</h3>
				<h6>Write an iterative function that is given an array of integers and the size of the array as parameters. 
				    Thefunction returns the sum of the integers in the array.</h6>

<pre><code>
int <strong>iterativeArraySum</strong>(int integers[], int size) {

				<h3>&#127770; ponder-2: Construct a Dispatcher for the Iterative Function</h3>
				<p>We will keep the iterative function and add a second function we will refer to as a dispatcher. The dispatcher will
					hand off most of the work to the previously written iterative function and use this
					information to solve the overall problem. To write a dispatcher, we have to follow
					two rules:
				</p>
					<h6>1. The dispatcher must completely handle the most trivial case, without calling the iterative function.</h6>
					<h6>2. The dispatcher, when calling the iterative function, must pass a smaller version of the problem.</h6>
				    <h6>Q1: What is the most trivial case in this problem?</h6>
					<p class="sol" id="sol-trivial-case">If the array's <code>size</code> is 0, then the function has been passed an array with a sum of 0.</p>
					<h6>Q2: Think of a way to pass a smaller version of the problem from the dispatcher to the iterative function.</h6>
					<p>There is no easy way to pass a smaller array, but we can easily pass a smaller value for <code>size</code>. 
					If the dispatcher is given the value of <code>10</code> for size, the function is being asked to compute the sum of 10 values in the array. 
					If the dispatcher passes <code>9</code> as the value of size to the iterative function, it is requesting the sum of the first <code>9</code> values in the array. 
					The dispatcher can then add the value of the one remaining value in the array (the 10th) to compute the sum of all 10 values. 
					Note that reducing size by 1 when calling the iterative function maximizes the work of the iterative function and thereby minimizes the work of the dispatcher.
				    the dispatcher function avoids as much work as possible.</p>
					<p>Putting these ideas together, here’s a dispatcher function for this problem:</p>
<pre><code>
	0     int <strong>arraySumDelegate</strong>(int integers[], int size) {
	1        if (size == 0)  return 0;  
	2        int lastNumber = integers[size - 1];
	3	      int allButLastSum = <strong>iterativeArraySum</strong>(integers, size - 1);
	4	      return lastNumber + allButLastSum;
	5     }
</code></pre>

					 <p>The first statement enforces the first rule of dispatchers: 
						It checks for a trivial case and handles it completely, in this case, by returning <code>0</code>. 
						Otherwise, control passes to the remaining code, which enforces the second rule. 
						The last number in the array is stored in a local variable called lastNumber, 
						and then the sum of all the other values in the array is computed via a call to the iterative function. 
						This result is stored in another local variable, allButLastSum, 
						and finally the function returns the sum of the two local variables.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="ponds">
				<h3>&#127770; ponder-3: Change the Name of the Dispatcher</h3>
				<p>If we have correctly created a dispatcher function, we have already effectively created a recursive solution. 
					This is the Big Recursive Idea in action. 
					To convert this iterative solution to a recursive solution requires but one further, simple step:
				</p>
				<h6>have the delegate function call itself where it was previously calling the iterative function.</h6>
				<p>We can then remove the iterative function altogether.</p>
<pre><code>
	int <strong>arraySumRecursive</strong>(int integers[], int size) {
		if (size == 0) return 0;
		int lastNumber = integers[size - 1];
		int allButLastSum = <strong>arraySumRecursive</strong>(integers, size - 1);
		return lastNumber + allButLastSum;
	}
</code></pre>
<p>Only two changes have been made to the previous code. The name of the function
	has been changed to better describe its new form, and the function now calls
	itself where it previously called the iterative function . The logic of the two
	functions, <code>arraySumDelegate</code> and <code>arraySumRecursive</code>, is identical. 
	Each function checks for a trivial case in which the sum is already known—in this case,
	an array of size 0 that has a sum of 0. 
	Otherwise, each function computes the sum of values in the array by 
	making a function call to compute the sum of all of the values, save the last one. 
	Finally, each function adds that last value to the returned sum for a grand total. 
	The only difference is that the first version of the function calls another function, 
	while the recursive version calls itself. The BRI tells us that 
	if we follow the rules outlined above for writing the dispatcher, 
	we can ignore that distinction.</p>

<div class="ponds">
	<h3>&#127770; wrap up: From Iteration to Recursion</h3>
	In particular, you usually would not implement an iterative solution to the problem before implementing a recursive solution.
	Writing an iterative function as a stepping-stone is extra work that will eventually be thrown away. 
	Besides, recursion is best applied to situations in which an iterative solution is difficult, as explained in the lecture. 
	However, you can follow the outline of this idea of modifying without actually writing the iterative solution. 
	The key is thinking of a recursive call as a call to another function, without regards to the internals of that function. 
	In this way, you remove the complexities of recursive logic from the recursive solution.

<div class="ponds">
	<h3>&#127770; ponder-4: Common Mistakes in Constructing Recursion</h3>
	<h6>1. Overthinking the problem or beginning implementation without a clear plan.</h6>
	<p>Code produced by overthinking can be recognized by its too-careful appearance. For example, a recursive function might
		have several special cases where it needs only one.</p>
    <h6>mistake example 1: Too Many Parameters</h6>
	<p>Consider our problem of recursively computing the sum of an array of integers. 
		Writing an iterative solution to this problem, the programmer knows a “running total” variable will be needed 
		(in the iterative solution provided, I called this sum) and the array will be summed starting from the first element. 
		Considering the recursive solution, the programmer naturally imagines an implementation that most directly mirrors the iterative solution, 
		with a running total variable and the first recursive call handling the first element in the array. 
		This approach, however, requires the recursive function to pass the running total and the location where 
		the next recursive call should begin processing. Such a solution would look like this:</p>
	<pre><code>
		int arraySumRecursiveExtraParams(int integers[], int size, int sum, int currentIndex) {
            if (currentIndex == size) return sum;
            sum += integers[currentIndex];
            return arraySumRecursiveExtraParameters(integers, size, sum, currentIndex + 1);
        }
	</code></pre>
	<p>This code is as short as the other recursive version but considerably more semantically complex 
		because of the additional parameters, sum and currentIndex. 
		From the client code’s point of view, the extra parameters are meaningless and will always have to be zeroes in the call, as shown in this example</p>
<pre><code>
	int a[10] = {20, 3, 5, 22, 7, 9, 14, 17, 4, 9};
	int total = arraySumRecursiveExtraParameters(a, 10, 0, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>
	The iterative function for this problem and the original recursive function answer the question, 
	what is the sum of this array with this many elements? In contrast, this second recursive function is being asked, 
	what is the sum of this array if it has this many elements, we are starting with this particular element, 
	and this is the sum of all the prior elements?
</p>
<h6>The “too many parameters” problem is avoided by choosing your function parameters before thinking about recursion. 
	In other words, force yourself to use the same parameter list you would if the solution were iterative.</h6>
<br>
<h3>Practice: write a recursive function that counted the number of zeros appearing in an array of integers. </h3>
<h3>Given the iterative function below, use it to create a recursive one.</h3>
<p>Suppose we were asked to write a recursive function that counted the number of zeros appearing in an array of integers. 
	This is a simple problem to solve using iteration:
<pre><code>
	int <strong>zeroCountIterative</strong>(int numbers[], int size) {
		int sum = 0;
		int count = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		if (numbers[i] == 0) count ++;
		}
		return count;
	}
